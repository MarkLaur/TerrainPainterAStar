# TerrainPainterAStar
This is a Unity project where the user can paint a map onto the Unity terrain and my A* algorithm calculates the fastest path through the different ground materials.
There will be at least 3 different materials: normal ground, sand that slows movement, and rocky ground that blocks movement.

# WIP
This is still a work in progress.
